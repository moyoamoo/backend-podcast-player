# Podcast Player

This is the backend for the final project made during The Jump Software Development Bootcamp. The project is a web based podcast player with a custom audio player with controls. I created a RESTful API, to handle account details (login, update and delete account, sending user emails), track listens, send back user stats, proxy for 3rd party API and caching. Data is saved in a MySQL database.
